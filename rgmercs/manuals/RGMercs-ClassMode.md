Class Modes are numerical values starting at 0. Pre-configured Class Modes will be between 0 and 99. User defined class modes in rgcustom.inc are reserved for 100+.

Class Mode help is available in `/rg help`.

To set the class mode for a user you can:
`/rg ClassMode #` where # is the class mode you want. You then restart the macro for the ClassMode to take affect.

If you commit a typo when setting ClassMode **THE MACRO WILL CRASH ON RESTART**. Thus,  **PLEASE BE CAREFUL**. If you commit a typo and end the macro, you can fix your typo but editing that character's INI file manually.

All basic modes are meant to work from levels 1-115 so will not be optimized for any era in the game. We do not accept recommendations for end game rotations that will break in earlier eras.
